As of now, I currently have little to no experience in software engineering. I am a complete baby to software engineering. So far, I've taken a few courses on programming languages and have a basic understanding of language concepts and the thought process of an programmer. Some takeaways I've acquired from these courses is that programmers have an entirely different way of looking at a problem. The mind of a programmer will disassemble a problem into tiny sub problems to divide and conquer and come up with 3-5 different approaches to solve this patricular problem. 
    
## What I hope to develop

I'm currently taking ICS 314 a softrware engineering course at the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. Throughout this semester, I hope to develop this mind of a programmer that I have been talking about. The creative and efficient problem solving mind is a valuable skillset to acquire. Having the mind of a developer will give me a competitive edge in my professional career path. Being able to put this ideaology into practice will give me first hand experience which is invaluble compared to traditional learning. 

Along side this mind of a programmer, utilizing soft skills will guide me to develop a large network of contacts among my peers. Since I was a kid, its been drilled into my head that life isn't all about book smarts; a lot of it is who you know. Establishing a large network of connections will benefit all parties involved to different degrees. Ultimately, I'm hoping to get the skillset required for a job or internship from my studies to better me as a candidate.
