## Inital Thoughts

While having just about a year's worth of coding experience, I've come across this language called JavaScript. JavaScript can be summarized into 1 word: short-cut. See here, I only know a bit of Java and C in comparison to the rest of programmers out there, but my first impressions with JavaScript were shocking. In this particular language, there are so many short-cuts and little things that end up confusing me as a user. However, the language itself is not too far off from C and Java, so the basic concepts are still there. 


### Why JavaScript is a Short-Cut

In JavaScript, I've found that naming variables is exceptionally easy, this includes ES6. For example, calling a function/method with 1 parameter that would normally be an int:

```
function example(param){
}
```

Here we don't use define what type of variable that parameter is, but in Java for example it would look like so:

```
static void example(int param){
}
```

Although this may seem like a 1 word short-cut, this type of variable defining tends to "trip" me while working through problems. In the broader sense of things, JavaScript is the superior language for quick, yet percise programming. 


#### Practice Makes Perfect

Like everything, putting in the time and effort to learn something new is very rewarding. I am not ashamed to admit that I've done poorly in the first "workout of the day" for my ICS 314 course. However, I now know exactly what kind of beast I'll be fighting throughout the semester and can prepare myself for what's to come. These workouts can be extremely stressful, but like everyting in life, practice makes perfect.
