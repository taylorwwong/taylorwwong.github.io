### What UI frameworks are
Basically, UI frameworks are a god sent gift from some guy who's leagues above what I can currently do. The creator of a UI must feel sorry for the plebians struggling at simple html and css. Or perhaps they were a like minded person who didn't want to sit there formatting for hours. 

A UI framework is a template that someone working with html can import into their files and use the interface to easily style their code. And although there is a learning curve for picking up UI's, it certainly does pay off well.


### My experiences with god's gift
Personally, I've worked with Semantic UI to format only 3 different html files. However, through my experiences with Semantic I've found that there is quite the large learning curve. For example, I've been using a CSS file to organize html code that already has a Semantic proptery. I'm sure there is a simpler way to go about formatting, such as padding, while also using Semantic, but adding another class and referencing that class in the CSS file is what I'm used to (old habits die hard huh). 

On the flip side, I've been abusing Semantic UI's shopping bag of goodies and have been very pleased with the results. Semantic was very easy to pick up and very very effective to put into practice. Although it is like learning a whole new language, it is also in basic English which helps accelerate the learning curve. 


### Why should we make the swap to UI
UI makes lives easier. While UI's do have a learning curve, it is 100% worth the time investment. Just putting some basic concepts from UI's can save programmers hours. I, myself, am a baby UI user and love skipping the extra minutes of plugging in random gibberish into CSS files. Just to sell my point further, UI is literally just imports at the top of the htrml file. You don't even have to use it if you don't want to. It's just a very good tool to have in your pocket.
