Kunoa Cattle Company is a company local to Hawaii. They do everything from raising cattle to producing end products on store shelves. 

For this project, my team and I worked through a semester long project trying to find a weakness in Kunoa Cattle Co's market. From branding to company image, the company was inspected from head to toe. My role in this particular project was data analysis of survey data we gathered through qualtrics and random sampling. As the one in charge of data analysis, excel became my best friend during the project. Comparing the numbers and finding trends through the data all to find that one area of improvement was the goal. Once all the numbers were compiled and ready to be put forth, we took our findings to present to the joint owners of the company. 

I've picked up a few valuable skills while working with my team. Pressing for deadlines and having precision time management is an invaluable skill. Without it, quotas and end results will not be met. Secondly, leadership and soft skills to work with others. Trying to lead a team is a tricky job. Everyone has their own agenda and problems they're currently facing, but being compassionate yet goal oriented can go a long way and produce amazing results.
