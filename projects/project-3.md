Rainbow Drive-In is a locally own buisness in Hawaii which caters towards tourist visiting the islands. 

This project was done by students at University of Hawaii at Manoa to find innovative ways to improve the customer experience. We were approached with the problem of lack of orginality at our iconic tourist destination. To combat this, we were given tourism data which included spending, and trends then asked to come up with new ways to improve the image of Rainbow Drive-In. 

My role in this project was to gather records and formulate a common trend with customer spending habits. Using excel and sales records from Rainbow Drive-In, I was tasked to find ways to reduce the cost for the company. By reducing the total cost for the company in their menu, The company could then reallocate resources into new ideas. The summary of my findings is that there was a lot of money wasted on items that weren't being sold at a high volume. So, my recommendation was to either cut those items out of the menu or to alter them to appeal to the consumers.

A major takeway from this project is learning how to read financial records and draw a conclusion from them. Working with those records is, to a certain extent, confidential so having the right wording while presenting the data is crucial. The wording can affect your liability and may hinder the end result.
