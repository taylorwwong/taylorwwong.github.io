summary: Edited my gameplay into a short video using Resolve 16
---

For this project, I've been playing ArcheAge for a few years and decided to put some clips together into a video. This is my very first time using Resolve 16 and OBS for recording/editing software. Firstly, I ran OBS in the background of my game to record the screen and hopefully capture decent footage. Once I've collected a handful of clips, I moved into Da Vinci Resolve 16 which is a video editing program. I managed to get a viral clip off the internet and used it for the intro. After speeding up the clips and beat matching, I've uploaded the first video to Youtube. 


During the course of editing and collecting clips, I've learned a few things. Firstly, don't rush. Editing takes a very long time and getting it down right can take hours. After production, I realised that speeding up the clips edits the frame rate and can lead to distorted quality if the entire project isn't saved in the right frames per seconds. Also that to produce results in HD, I needed to set the render quality to 50000+ which I failed to do here. 

This first attempt of recording and editing turned out below my expectations, however, I am now prepared to do it right the next time.
